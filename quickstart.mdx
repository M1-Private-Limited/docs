## Understanding GEN-AI

Get to grips with the basics of General AI and how it's changing the industry.

### What is GEN-AI?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="The Basics of Gen-AI">
    General AI, used in ChatGPT, is a form of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply its knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like a human brain. Unlike traditional AI, which is specialized for specific tasks, GEN-AI has the versatility to handle various problems and situations, making it more adaptable and intelligent in different environments.

  ```md Example Prompt
You are a hypersonalized email content generator for a marketing team in a telco industry called M1. Keep the email short in 1-2 sentences and straight to the point. 
You will be given a marketing campaign message and a customer profile. Content is: {campaign_message}. 
Study the customer profile well, the profile is: {profile} and craft a hypersonalized email content based off the where the customer profile and the campaign context.
Always start with Hi customer's name! Do not sign off. Make sure theres a direct Benefit, price.
 Add a Call for Action at the last sentence. Remember, keep the email very short and summarised and be very cheerful and excited.

#### Enhancing Image Analysis

  <Accordion  title="Summarising complicated diagrams">
  GEN-AI can easily analyse complicated dashboards or diagrams to give a layman text summary to the reader. 
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Original Tech Architect Diagram">

  <Tab title="GEN-AI Analysis">
  ```md GEN-AI Layman Summary
This diagram is like a blueprint that shows the different parts of a software system and how they connect.

The "Clients" part refers to the apps that people use on their phones or computers. These are made with a tool called Flutter, which works for Android, iPhone, and web browsers.

The "Apps" section is the heart of the system where all the main functions happen. It's organized into small, independent services that talk to each other. They handle requests from the user apps through a sort of traffic director (API Gateway) that's set up on Amazon's cloud service. This part also includes tools to manage the code, keep secrets safe, and check that everything is running smoothly.

The "Data" part deals with storing and organizing information. It has two main types of storage: one for detailed data like user profiles (Metadata) and another for files like photos and videos (Media). There's also a quick-access memory (Caching layer) to make common data retrievable faster.

The "3rd Party Apps" are additional services from other companies that the system uses for specific tasks like chatting, verifying user identities, helping customers, processing payments, sending emails and text messages, and creating user avatars (like profile pictures).

In simple terms, this system is a complex network that supports a software application, handling everything from the app on your phone to the servers that process and store your data, with lots of security and tools to monitor how well everything is working.

## How to write GEN-AI prompts
To write effective prompts for generative AI, consider the following four tips:

<Tip> 1. Be Specific: Detail your request including topic, response length, style, structure, intent, and output format.</Tip>
<Tip> 2. Provide Context: Offer relevant background information to help the AI understand your topic better.</Tip>

<Tip>3. Ask Single Questions: Stick to one question or request at a time for clearer responses.</Tip>

<Tip>4. Experiment and Iterate: If unsatisfied with the response, rephrase or add more details to your prompt.</Tip>

## Limitations of GEN-AI
When using generative AI, be aware of its current limitations:

<Warning>1. Real-Time Information Limitation: Generative AI and large language models lack access to the latest information (unless it has access to the web). They're not ideal for acquiring current news or live data.</Warning>

<Warning>2. Mathematical Limitations: Generative AI handles basic arithmetic but may falter with complex math like statistical analysis, though future improvements are likely.</Warning>

<Warning>3. Restrictions on Data Usage: Exercise caution with data entered into AI tools. Refrain from using sensitive customer data, personally identifiable information, or data under non-disclosure agreements without proper legal and security clearances.</Warning>

<Warning>4. Potential for AI Hallucinations: Be aware that generative AI can create 'hallucinations' or false information. Always double-check the accuracy of AI-generated content.</Warning>
